neither	STOP TAKING BATHROOM SELFIES YOU FUCKING PEASANT

neither	Is synergy usually so laggy over wifi?
neither	The #BSDCan committee is discussing papers fast &amp; furious. I'm guessing we'll be late. So much good stuff this year!

neither	i know. my heart is breaking. (not really. i do tweet a *LOT*)
neither	he fucked a cousin and kicked a woman out for refusing to suck his dog's dick. #coon

neither	what i took out of this is that i am @Glinner's sockpuppet, correct me if I am wrong.
neither	(And the sad thing is, to list all the names affected by this crap would take days, if not months. Time to fix it.)
neither	Most tellingly of all, hashtag + target mentions are up. @spacekatgal has received 474 mentions in the past 12 hours w/gamergate ht.
neither	sorry about the trolls. i've got that user blocked, but they tend to monitor my timeline. :\
neither	Fortunately, we've got controls on Twitter like block and mute, which keep us from seeing *most* things we don't like.

neither	in WoD, you see manrik and his wife as children. COME BAAAAACK.
sexism	Another example of comments that female FOSS devs get on a regular basis. Don't like her code? Insult her appearance! http://t.co/haTKHRheNf
neither	I'm really enjoying how one of the product images is just a stick of gum. Also, there's cupcake flavored. Please let there be a cupcake pic.
neither	It's unfortunate, because I'd like to leave twitter as an avenue available to GamerGaters that have been targeted.
neither	hi! I like your game, but I'm bad at it. :D  All I play is Teemo.
neither	HOLY SHIT I READ YOUR BOOKS
neither	If you get a follow from @randileeharper, yes, that is me. Being a CEO is scary, and I want a private account for yelling :P
neither	I kinda reallllllly want a magnetic implant in my fingertip now.

sexism	You're welcome to choke on it, hateful, condescending feminazi.
neither	I should stop drinking coffee now.
neither	I am grumpy over having to argue about if CNAMEs are allowed to have underscores. .  . It's in the freaking RFC. üò§

neither	also, mentioning both of us in the same tweet is pretty much a sure-fire way to make sure that they do notice &amp; jump on me.
racism	#BlameOneNotAll is bad because I should be able to hate entire demographics of people for the bad things individuals do to me! #racismyall

neither	I remember hearing of something bad in conjunction with this person - came under fire from a lot of people iirc
neither	pretty sure there is.
neither	guys. show me the data. show me your github. tell me your story. show me something that makes me think you're not a bag of useless opinions.
neither	#BlameOneNotAll because the problem is clearly not systemic at all. That's why all problems ended 1000 years ago when the only bad guy died.

neither	something that needs to be addressed, for sure.
sexism	I support #GamerGate because I'm a Gamer and i don't want a bunch of corrupt Media Feminazi's ruining video games for everyone.
neither	That #BegaCheese ad is SO old I'm wondering if the old digger is still alive...  #MKR  lol
sexism	Your cartoon about men opening a gate for women--Why not just move aside and let the women open it? #BlameOneNotAll
sexism	Dude just yelled at me loud enough to hear over my music + noise canceling headphones. "HEY GIRL. YOU WALK LIKE SWAAAGGER." Fuck yeah, I do.
sexism	#breakingfreeFromFeministIdiots http://t.co/Dtok5PSc2N
neither	haven't run it against you.
neither	That whole #ImACelebrityAU show is starting to look pretty damn good @Channel7 #MKR
neither	it's incorrect. it's in no way related to email addresses (are these people technical?)
sexism	For instance, if you think gaming has a problem with sexism that needs to be addressed? You're a radical feminazi.
neither	i think people should care less about their opinion. the only people listening to GG are GG.
neither	*GGers joke about target's children.* . Mark Kern: "Freedom of expression. Will you join us?" [Repeat] . #StopGamerGate http://t.co/pPrNwxsP2l
neither	maybe, i can't right now. scrambling on work/moving stuff. ask me later?

neither	hah! We have to secure funding first.
sexism	I liked a @YouTube video http://t.co/3Z3OAyLO69 UKIP's Nigel Farage vs loud Feminazi
neither	I don't have to do it, but given that it's such a high priority, I need to put some time into it until we have it figured out.
neither	isn't it weird that protesting irl has more protection (for whilte ppl at least) than saying things online?
neither	Pocky 4ever. http://t.co/Sah8xed05T
neither	Old dude in this cafe: "my grandmother had blue hair"
neither	TIL I'm the district attorney.
neither	I reached out to @ninaburleigh with concerns the day the article was published. No response. Nina cares more about page views than problems.
neither	RMAed my monoprice. Shoddy power bricks on those. Getting a refund and picking up another ASUS VG278HE. It's cheaper, anyways.

neither	I used a shock collar on a guy once before. He was a coworker. In my defense, he asked me to.

neither	#BlameOneNotAll
sexism	NOPE. mostly angry feminists and people pissed he killed a character.
neither	while i'm not against torrents in the slightest, i have to admit that 1 person pirating now enables MANY others.
sexism	Ah the feminazi battle bus invading a town near you soon!
neither	OAPI got a mention on Kotaku. :) http://t.co/ME8NWsU7wo
neither	We're being honest with each other, rogue is way too busy harassing people to even start working on a game.
neither	not sure yet, but I've heard good things from many people.
neither	i'm pretty familiar with the concept, but not the feeling. ^.^ good read, though.
neither	hahaha, coworker randomly reached out on LI. "Btw, I'm at reddit now!"  "OH LORDY, WE'RE GONNA BE CHATTING SOON. Sorry in advance."
neither	what's funny is that I was drunk when I wrote it - and I wrote it for myself, not as something I planned on sharing.
neither	lush vanilla powder also makes a good dry conditioner.
sexism	Similar to how a woman merely knowing her stuff is seen as an intimidating and aggressive instead of just standard competency. @freebsdgirl
neither	#BlameOneNotAll http://t.co/2kk6cXxHnX
neither	so jealous
neither	No. However, we do have unequal biology. I'm not the one who thinks its worth complaining about.
neither	is this 1997??? who uses MSN????
neither	If you are feeling perturbed about women that aren't humble, kindly go set yourself on fire.

sexism	.@Laurel325 As a mom of daughters, I am asking if you would call them 'sluts, sexretary or FemiNAZI'? Rush does &amp; you pay for it. #stoprush

neither	Can't decide whether that's the original or this one on Facebook. Both are dated May 1st. . https://t.co/rji8eVct0T
neither	Weeeee. That's what I get for grumping/joking about a family member. Random internet rage. http://t.co/wIXP48clwv
neither	People with good intentions can still do shitty things. This applies to Joss Whedon. This applies to the people threatening him.
